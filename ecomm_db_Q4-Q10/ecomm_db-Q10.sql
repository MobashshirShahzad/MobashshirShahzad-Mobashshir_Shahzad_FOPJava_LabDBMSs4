# Q10) Create a stored procedure to display supplier id, name, Rating(Average rating of all the products sold by every customer) and
#      Type_of_Service. For Type_of_Service, If rating =5, print Excellent Service,If rating >4 print Good Service, If rating >2 print Average
#      Service else print Poor Service.Note that there should be one rating per supplier.
